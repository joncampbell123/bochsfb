bochsfb - A General Driver for Bochs VBE and VirtualBox-based VMs
========================================================================

1. Requirements
---------------

bochsfb has been extensively tested against VirtualBox OSE 4.0 and higher.
It will use the base VBE extensions offered by Bochs to allow modesetting,
and make use of VirtualBox's OMAPI extensions if available.

The latest source code is available at:

http://hackipedia.org/Projects/bochsfb/

For best results make sure you have enough (emulated) video RAM for the
modes you want to use. For multi-monitor support, it is recommended that
you assign a minimum of 32MB of video RAM for two, plus 16MB for each
additional monitor, to the virtual machine.

2. Caveats and limitations
--------------------------

- Should work with the Bochs emulator (in VBE vga mode), but not
  extensively tested yet.

- Supports VirtualBox's multi-monitor emulation by registering multiple
  framebuffer devices, but writes to the framebuffer device are not
  visible until you use a special ioctl() to trigger a screen update.
  This is a limitation of VirtualBox, not this driver.

- Does not use or attempt to use 2D or 3D acceleration offered by VirtualBox.

- Not usable in emulators that do not emulate VBE extensions, such as QEMU.

3. Configuration
----------------

bochsfb is a kernel module that you load at boot time when needed. It is not
yet a driver that you can compile into the kernel.

If you are running Linux kernel 3.10.x or higher and your VGA device is
currently taken by a general firmware device such as efifb, loading bochsfb
in VirtualBox will kick the generic driver aside automatically.

Once loaded, you can use the `fbset' utility to change video resolution and
bit depth. Under Bochs and VirtualBox you can set 8/15/16/24/32bpp modes.
The flexible nature of the interface also allows you to set any arbitrary
dimensions you want. You are not limited to 640x480 or 1024x768 in any way.

To use this driver with X Windows, modify your X configuration file to load
the fbdev driver. If your X configuration relies on auto-detection you still
need to add an explicit reference to the "fbdev" driver. X does not consider
fbdev when auto-detecting the card.

4. VirtualBox screen refresh ioctl()
------------------------------------

If you are developing code to draw on bochsfb's secondary monitors you will
first need to identify this driver. Use strncmp() to match "Bochs VBE" or
"Bochs VBE/" in the framebuffer's name field.

These procedures are not needed for the primary VGA display in VirtualBox.

After drawing on the screen, you will need to issue an ioctl() to trigger a
screen update so that VirtualBox knows it needs to redraw the screen. There
are two ioctls to accomplish this: one to refresh the entire screen, the
other to refresh a specific rectangular portion of the screen.

struct bochsfb_rect {
	uint16_t	x,y,w,h;
};

#define BOCHSFB_FLUSH		_IO('B',1)
#define BOCHSFB_FLUSH_RECT	_IOW('B',2, struct bochsfb_rect)
